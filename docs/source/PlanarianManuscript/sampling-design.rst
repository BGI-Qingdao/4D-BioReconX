Sampling Design
===============
This section contains description of our sampling design and data organization in STOmicsDB.

Sampling
--------
Planarian animals of one uninjured individual and 16 regenerative individuals from eight distinct stages were sampled.

Sample fixation
---------------
Individuals were embedded into two OCT blocks, of which relevant data were organized as two samples in `STOmicsDB <https://db.cngb.org/stomics/>`_ database.

  * `STSA0000255 <https://db.cngb.org/stomics/sample/STSA0000255/>`_

Stereo-seq
----------
Each sample block was serially sectioned at 10 Âµm intervals throughtout the entire animal body. Each section was individually mounted onto the Stereo-seq chip.

Sections on the chip were stained with nucleic acid dye for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) visualization and further processed throughout library construction and sequencing.
