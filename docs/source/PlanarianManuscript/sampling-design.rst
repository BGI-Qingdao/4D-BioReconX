Sampling Design and Data Organization
========================================
This section contains description of our sampling design and data organization in STOmicsDB.

Sampling
---------------------------------
<img src='../_static/sampling design.png' width=300 align='right' hspace='50' />Planarian animals of one uninjured individual and 16 regenerative individuals from eight distinct stages were sampled.


Sample fixation
---------------------------------
<img src='../_static/oct embedding.png' width=300 align='right' hspace='50' /> Individuals were embedded into two OCT blocks, of which relevant data were organized as two samples in [STOmicsDB](https://db.cngb.org/stomics/) database. 
- [STSA0000254](https://db.cngb.org/stomics/sample/STSA0000254/)
- [STSA0000255](https://db.cngb.org/stomics/sample/STSA0000255/)


Stereo-seq
---------------------------------
<img src='../_static/section.png' width=300 align='right' hspace='50' /> Each sample block was serially sectioned at 10 Âµm intervals throughtout the entire animal body. Each section was individually mounted onto the Stereo-seq chip. 

Sections on the chip were stained with nucleic acid dye for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) visualization and further processed throughout library construction and sequencing.
