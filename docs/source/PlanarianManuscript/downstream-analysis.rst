Downstream Analysis
======================
This section contains description of downstream analysis including SPC clustering, PCG analysis, cell-cell connection analysis, cell colocation estimation and meta-niche analysis.

SPC clustering
--------------


Spatial gradient gene profiling
-------------------------------
Each 3D individual was digitally split into body fragments with equal length along A/P, M/L, and D/V axes, from which the gene expression of each fragment was calculated by averaging sctransform-based data following :ref:`/tutorials/gene_profiling.rst`.

.. note:: 
    The digitally split was performed after the body straightening following :ref:`/tutorials/body_straightening.rst`.

Principal component analysis of PCGs
------------------------------------




Cell-cell connection analysis
