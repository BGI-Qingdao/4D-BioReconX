## Stereo-seq sequencing data preprocess

Stereo-seq sequencing data were preprocessed using [SAW](https://github.com/STOmics/SAW) to generation spatial gene expression matrices in [GEM format](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials/IO.html#GEM).

Image files, which usually in TIFF format, generated during the stereo-seq library construction process should be ready for further process together with the GEM files.

> [!NOTE]
> All data generated in this study were deposited at CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive (accession code: STT0000028). Processed data can be interactively explored from our PRISTA4D database (https://db.cngb.org/stomics/prista4d; https://www.bgiocean.com/planarian).
